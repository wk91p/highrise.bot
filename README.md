## Change Log

**Changed**

- Removing `HighriseCluster` temporary

### 2.6.1

**Fixed**

**Added**
- Added log level filtering. `new Logger(prefix, level)` now accepts an optional second argument (`'debug' | 'info' | 'warn' | 'error'`) to set the minimum level shown, defaults to `'debug'`.

**Changed**
- Removed file/line location output from `log.debug()`.
